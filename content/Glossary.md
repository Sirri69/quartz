- **Somatosensory**: The somatosensory system is the network of neural structures in the brain and body that produce the perception of touch, as well as temperature, body position, and pain. It is a subset of the sensory nervous system, which also represents visual, auditory, olfactory, and gustatory stimuli. ^d90499
- **Receptive Field**: The receptive field, or sensory space, is a delimited medium where some physiological stimuli can evoke a sensory neuronal response in specific organisms. Complexity of the receptive field ranges from the unidimensional chemical structure of odorants to the multidimensional spacetime of human visual field, through the bidimensional skin surface, being a receptive field for touch perception. ^5efcda
- **Retinotopic Map**: Term referring to the fact that the precise spatial arrangement of the retina is maintained throughout the visual pathway. ^e856bf
- **Hypercolumn**: A Hypercolumn is a group of nerve cells in the brain that helps us interpret what we see by enabling us to analyze the size, shape, speed, and direction of visual stimuli. It is a set of columns that function as a unit that enables us to see one specific portion of the visual field.
- **Deoxyglucose:** Deoxyglucose is a molecule that is similar to glucose, but with a minor change in its structure. That change causes this molecule to get stuck in the metabolic chain. And so it gets taken up by cells that wanna take glucose, and then it get stuck it there and cannot be broken down. Hence, it builds up in cells that are metabolically active. You can put a radioactive tracer in deoxyglucose, inject it into a person or animal, then it builds up as a radioactive tag on all the cells that were metabolically active.

- **Fusiform Face Area:** The fusiform face area (FFA, meaning spindle-shaped face area) is a part of the human visual system (while also activated in people blind from birth) that is specialized for facial recognition. It is located in the inferior temporal cortex (IT), in the fusiform gyrus ^d42ddf
- **Independent variable:** The factor the experimenter manipulates. (e.g. stimulus type) usually this is varied across several conditions (e.g., faces, objects) 
- **Dependent variable:** The thing the experimenter measures e.g., magnitude of fMRI (BOLD) response in a given voxel or region 
- **Hypothesis:** The key idea you are testing in the experiment. 
- **Prediction:** The precise finding in your data that should be found if the hypothesis is true.
- **Confound:** A difference between your conditions other than the one you are trying to manipulate, that hence provides an alternative account of your data.
- **Contrast:** an activation is generally based on a contrast of two conditions, e.g. finding voxels that respond faces > objects. The point of a contrast is to isolate a mental process… The thing the experimenter measures e.g., magnitude of fMRI (BOLD) response in a given voxel or region

- **Blocked Trials:** In the field of neurology and learning, Blocked Trials refer to a learning method where a single type of task or information is practiced repeatedly in a 'block' before moving on to the next task. This approach allows for concentrated, intensive practice of one skill at a time, making it easier for the learner to grasp and master each individual skill before moving on to the next. ^04c2d4
- **Spaced Mixed Trials:** Spaced Mixed Trials involve practicing multiple tasks or types of information in a mixed order, but with intervals or 'spaces' between each practice session. This method is believed to enhance memory consolidation and retrieval by promoting cognitive effort and variability in practice. The spacing between each session provides time for the brain to process and consolidate the information, leading to better long-term retention. ^61a227
- **Rapid Mixed Trials: **Rapid Mixed Trials also involve practicing multiple tasks or types of information in a mixed order, but without any intervals or 'spaces' between each practice session. This method is typically more challenging as it requires quick switching between tasks, testing the learner's adaptability and cognitive flexibility. It may promote better generalization of skills as it simulates real-world scenarios where one has to rapidly switch between different tasks. ^1ed9c1
