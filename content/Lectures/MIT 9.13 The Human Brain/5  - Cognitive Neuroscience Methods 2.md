## fMRI: Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**
- Best spatial resolution available for studies on normal subjects.
- Noninvasive

**Disadvantages:**
- Can't tell if activity measured plays a casual role in cognition/behavior.
- The physiological basis of BOLD is unclear (synaptic activity vs spikes). We don't know what exactly is going at the neuronal level.
- Spatial resolution a ~1 mm at best (difficult to see cortical columns). It is the best, yet not good enough.
- Expensive (>$600/hr).
- "Susceptibility artifact" due to magnetic inhomogeneities near eat canals and sinuses.
- Loud banging noise. Causes problems when scanning infants, doing auditory experiments, etc.
- Temporal resolution not on a par with visual information processing. This is because BOLD signals take time to present themselves. Blood takes time to flow.

## Electroencephalography (EEG)
12-100+ scalp electrodes measure electrical response in brain, summing over LOTS of neurons.

These electrodes measure electrical potentials on the scalp.

- Poor spatial resolution. This is because electrical potentials blur all over the scalp.
- Old analogy: Like microphone on roof of football stadium: can tell when touchdown occurs, but that’s all. *Lot of noise when touchdown happens will make the mic catch some data, low noises won't.* But this is changing...

Thorpe et al (1996) assigned reading: How fast can we tell if image contains animal?

**First method:** Ask people to click a button when they see an image and record reaction times. We don't want to use this because this will also measure the time of motor response, not just detection time.

**Second method:** Use EEG.

Average ERP responses over frontal electrodes over 15 subjects for trials containing animals vs not:

**So, how fast can people do this? Is the animal detection finished by then? Might it have started earlier?**

Key thing to notice here is that the curves diverge at 150ms. Something is happening at 150ms when there is an animal or not. It could mean that the animal detection has started or has already ended and something else has started happening.

### Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)

Event-related potentials (ERPs) are electrical brain responses that occur in response to specific events or stimuli. ERPs are obtained by averaging the EEG (electroencephalogram) signals recorded from multiple trials, aligning them to the onset of the stimulus, and extracting the underlying brain activity that is time-locked to the event. ERPs provide a high temporal resolution, allowing researchers to examine the precise timing and sequence of neural processes associated with various cognitive functions.

Here a face-specific response can be detected at 170 ms after stimulus onset, showing:

- more evidence that some brain mechanism is specific to faces
- faces are discriminated from nonfaces by 170 ms (fast). 
- Does this signal come from the FFA?  - In this case we do not.

## Magnetoencephalography (MEG)

MEG is a neuroimaging technique that measures the magnetic fields generated by neural activity in the brain. MEG provides a high temporal resolution similar to EEG but with better spatial localization. It involves using an array of superconducting sensors to detect the tiny magnetic fields produced by the electrical currents in the brain.

MEG measures the magnetic fields generated by the electrical currents produced by active neurons in the brain. It provides high temporal resolution and spatial localization, primarily focusing on the gray matter regions. The electrical currents in the gray matter generate magnetic fields, while the myelinated axons in the white matter allow for the propagation of these currents. MEG sensors detect these magnetic fields

300+ sensors arrayed around head. Measure magnetic fields produced by current in neurons. (right hand rule!). If you align your hand with right hand rule with thumb towards the arrows, you will see that the magnetic activity sticks out of the brain. MEG detects that.

- MEG primarily “ sees ” activity in brain’s folds (sulci), not bumps (gyri).
- Fields ≅ 10-13Tesla, ~ 106 times weaker than earth's magnetic field.
- Need lots of shielding.
- Detectors = Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) cooled to-269 degrees with liquid helium.

**Can MEG Tell us anything about Face Perception?**
YES!

- Shows that face detection occurs quickly. (what about recognition?) 
- Implicates specialized cortical machinery for doing it.


## Advantages/Disadvantages of EEG and MEG

**Advantages:**
- Noninvasive 
- Excellent temporal resolution. (Why would we care about time?) 
- The methods described so far rely on finding specific selective responses. But new ML methods can ~ “decode” from ERP and MEG responses what the person saw/thought. This works surprisingly well. Opening up lots of research possibilities. More on that later.

**Disadvantages:**
- Lousy spatial resolution. Ill-posed “inverse problem”. What are we gonna do about that?

## Intracranial Recording: The One Method with High Spatial and Temporal Resolution

Intracranial recording is a neuroimaging method that provides the highest spatial and temporal resolution among all techniques. It involves the placement of electrodes directly inside the brain or on its surface to record neural activity. By positioning the electrodes close to the source of activity, intracranial recordings offer unparalleled spatial precision. Additionally, the high temporal resolution allows for the precise timing of neuronal events. Intracranial recording is typically used in clinical settings for patients with epilepsy to identify seizure origins, but it also offers valuable insights into brain function, connectivity, and the dynamics of neural networks.

### Intracranial Recording: Individual Neurons in the human FFA

This surgeon inserted electrodes into brain which have tiny micro wires coming out of them which can record responses from individual neurons.

## Advantages/Disadvantages of Intracranial Recording

**Advantages:**
- The only method in humans w/ high spatial and temporal resolution

**Disadvantages:**
- Invasive; Only possible in patients with neurological problems. 
- Data are rare and hard to control.
- Can’t tell if activity measured plays a causal role in cognition/behavior! <span style="color: orange"> that won’t do! causality is the essence of scientific understanding what are we gonna do? to test the causal role of region X in behavior we need to mess with X! that is, disrupt X, and see what happens to behavior. </span>

## Double Dissociation

One can have normal looking FFA and still have issues recognizing faces. This is because there are multiple aspects of a task. Along with FFA you need things like memory and ability to differentiate faces and objects, etc. Also one can have a normal FFA but the pathway connecting the FFA and other regions of the brain can be messed up.
