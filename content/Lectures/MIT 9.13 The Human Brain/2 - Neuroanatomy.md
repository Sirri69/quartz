# Neuroanatomy

## Some Bare Basics about the Brain
- The human brain contains around 100 billion ($10^{11}$) neurons.
- This is what a neuron looks like. ![[Pasted image 20220227023133.png]]
- Myelin sheath is a rolled-up sheet of fat around the axon, it makes the axon conduct neural signals faster.
- The human brain runs on mere 20 watts.

 ## Four major components of the brain
 
### 1. Brain Stem & Cerebellum 

The brain stem is a set of relays between the spinal cord and cerebellum. Most "primitive" part of the human brain, but also most essential to life. Meaning it is shared by most of the animals far behind us in the mammalian evolution.

The brain stem controls basic crucial bodily functions, like breathing, consciousness, temperature regulation, etc.

The cerebellum is involved in motor coordination. But people debate about it's possible in cognition.

### 2. Limbic System (subcortical regions)

3 important subcortical bits: Thalamus, Hippocampus, Amygdala

**Thalamus:** 
- Most incoming sensory information makes a stop in the thalamus en route to the cortex.
- The olfactory system is the one sensory modality that doesn't make a stop in the thalamus. It goes straight up into the olfactory cortex from the nose.
- Thalamus is not just a relay up to the cortex. Many connections go back down to the thalamus. E.g. there are ten times as many connections that go from the primary visual cortex back to the thalamus, then connections that go from the thalamus to the primary visual cortex.
- The lateral geniculate nucleus is a relay center in the thalamus for the visual pathway. It is a small, ovoid, ventral projection of the thalamus where the thalamus connects with the optic nerve. There are two LGNs, one on the left and another on the right side of the thalamus.
- Possible role in complex computations, task switching. Stunning work in mice.

**Hippocampus**
- Involves in long-term memory and navigation.

**Amygdala**
- Means almond in Greek.
- Involved in experiencing emotions, especially fear. No amygdala, no fear. 
- The four Fs amygdala are involved in Fighting, Fleeing, Feeding, and Mating.

### 3. White Matter

- Grey matter is the cell body.
- White matter is the myelinated axons. Axons travel in bundles in white matter.
- White matter makes up 45% of the human brain.

### 4. Cerebral Cortex (outer sheet)

Taught in depth below.


## Cortex

![[Pasted image 20220227040132.png|550]]

Primary sensory regions: visual cortex, auditory cortex, [[Glossary#^d90499|somatosensory]] cortex, gustatory taste cortex.  These are the first place where sensory information lands up at the cortex coming from senses. Every one of these regions are organized according to maps. To understand what a map is, you must understand what a [[Glossary#^5efcda|receptive field]] is.

### Receptive Field

**A receptive field is the place in the visual world, that makes a given neuron fire.**
In other words, if a certain neuron fires when a stimulus happens at point A, then point A is in the receptive field of that neuron.

Here is how you map the receptive field as a property of an individual cell in a brain.

- The classic way is to place an electrode in the monkey brain next to a neuron in the monkey's visual cortex. Every time that neuron fires, you get a spike on the chart/graph. 
- Train the monkey to stare at a fixation spot, without moving its eyes.
- Simulate various regions of the visual space, not the point monkey is staring at.
- <span style="color: orange">A cell will respond to stimulation in one part of space more than any others.</span>
- The region where the simulation happened, is the receptive field of that neuron.

Different cells have different RF, some cells' response is not only tuned to the location of the stimulus, but also other properties, like shape, color, the direction of motion, etc.

**Nearby cells in the cortex have nearby receptive fields**, producing [[Glossary#^e856bf|retinotopic maps]] in the visual cortex.

Tootell did an [experiment](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.7134981) where he had a monkey focus on a point (F in image), and then he provided stimulus around it. He injected the monkey with [[Glossary#^191f8b|deoxyglucose]] while he was staring at the point. Then he killed the monkey, rolled out the visual cortex onto a sheet, and you can see the bullseye pattern the monkey was looking at, across the surface of the visual cortex.

Terminology: V1 = Primary Visual Cortex, cortex = Striate cortex

This proves that adjacent parts of the visual scene are mapped to the adjacent parts of the cortex.

Just as we have maps for visual space, we have maps for other senses too,

### Cortical Area
Criteria: A region of cortex distinct from its neighbors in:
- Function
- Connectivity of other areas
- Distinctive layer structure/cell types ("cytoarchitecture"), only sometimes. - Broddman Areas

Example: Visual Motion area MT 
<sup><sub>MT = Middle Temporal </sub></sup>

One good way of knowing if a cortical area has a specific function is to stick electrodes in the brain of a monkey and record from individual neurons in the region.

This figure shows how responsive a neuron is when the stimulus moves a certain way. This also represents the *direction selectivity* of the neuron.

![[Pasted image 20220306235412.png]]

And as you move across the cortex in the same region, you see a systematic change in the direction selectivity of the neurons.

![[Pasted image 20220306235759.png]]

We get similar data via fMRI (functional MRI) in humans. Although sticking electrodes in the human brain is possible but are VERY rare.
