# Introduction to Human Brain

## Themes of the course
- Brain is not an amorphous mess, it has a proper structure. With diffrent parts that do diffrent things.
	- That's good because then we can solve diseases and research in a better way. Divide and conquer
- Some parts of the brain do **extremely** specific things. Not all, but some.
- The organization of brain, represents the architecture of our mind.
- How brains change.
- Which methods can be used to study brain.

## Why should we study the brain
- Know thyself. Your brain is your identity.
- To understand the origins and limitations of human knowledge.
- To advance AI.
	- Bot humans and deepnets are good at pattern recognition, but they ae not good at *building models to understand the world*.

## How to study the human brain
Question: How does this thing work? We can approach this question at multiple levels:
- Molecules and their interactions
- Properties of individual neurons
- Circuits of interacting neurons
- Brain regions
- Network of brain regions 

But in this course we explore, *How does the brain give rise to the mind?*  To answer that we need to start at the mind and various mental functions it includes, like:
- Perception
- Vision
- Hearing
- Cognition
- Language
- Thinking about people, things etc.

 For each mental function we will:
 1. Understand how it works in minds, what is computed and how?
 2. Look at it's brain basis, specialized brain machinery? What, when and how information is represented?

How do we answer these questions? Lots of methods:
- Psychophysics
	- RT & accuracy
- Illusions
- Neuropsychology patients
- MRI
- Neurophysiology - animals and humans (ECoG)
- EEG (scalp electrodes) ERPs
- Magnetoencephalography (MEG)
- Diffusion tractography
